# Bike-Sales-Analysis
I have designed and implemented a comprehensive Excel project, which includes the development of multiple dashboards and tables for advanced data analysis. The project involves a structured approach across various stages, such as data processing, data cleaning, and data visualization.

## Project Objective
The Bike Sales Company aims to develop an interactive and comprehensive dashboard to analyze customer demographics, buying behavior, and other relevant factors that impact bike sales.

## Datasheet Used

## Qestions KPI'S

--> Total Bike Sales 
- Measures the total number of bikes sold within a selected time period (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
- Helps evaluate overall business performance and sales growth trends.
  
--> Sales by Region 
- Tracks the number of bikes sold in different regions (e.g., Europe, North America, Pacific).
- Identifies high-performing and underperforming regions to optimize marketing strategies.
  
--> Bike Purchase Conversion Rate (%)
- Measures the percentage of potential customers who actually buy a bike, helping assess the effectiveness of sales strategies.
  
--> Average Income of Bike Buyers 
- Compares the average income of customers who purchased a bike versus those who did not.
- Helps determine pricing strategies and identify target income segments.
  
--> Commute Distance & Purchase Correlation 
- Measures the percentage of purchases based on commute distance (0-1 miles, 1-2 miles, etc.).
- Helps the company understand how commuting habits influence bike purchases.
  
--> Sales by Marital Status & Education Level 
- Tracks bike purchases based on marital status (Single vs. Married) and education level (Bachelors, Graduate Degree, etc.).
- Provides insights into customer preferences and informs targeted marketing campaigns.

## Process
- Reviewed key fields such as Income, Marital Status, Region, Education, Commute Distance, and Age.
- Identified and handled missing values.
- Ensured data consistency (correct data types, uniform formats, and standardized values).
- Removed duplicates to maintain accuracy.
- Created Pivot Tables to summarize bike purchase trends by Income, Gender, Age, Commute Distance, and Region.
- Used calculated fields where necessary to derive additional insights.
- Designed a Bar Chart to compare Average Income Per Purchase for Male vs. Female customers.
- Created Line Charts to analyze Commute Distance vs. Bike Purchases and Customer Age vs. Bike Purchases.
- Integrated all Pivot Tables, Charts, and Slicers into a single, easy-to-use interactive dashboard.
- Applied Slicers for Marital Status, Region, and Education Level to allow dynamic filtering.
- Enhanced the dashboard with clear titles, legends, and color coding for better readability.

## Project Insight

- Higher Income Leads to More Bike Purchases – Customers with higher incomes, especially females, are more likely to buy bikes, suggesting premium bike options can be targeted at this group.
- Commute Distance Affects Buying Behavior – People traveling 1-2 miles are the most frequent buyers, meaning bikes can be marketed as a short-distance commuting solution.
- Middle-Aged Customers Buy More Bikes – Older age groups show lower purchase rates, indicating an opportunity to introduce senior-friendly or electric bike options.
- Regional & Marital Status Influence Sales – Certain regions have higher sales, and single individuals are more likely to buy bikes, highlighting areas for targeted promotions.
- Opportunities for Business Growth – The company can offer installment plans, expand marketing, promote commuting benefits, and introduce discounts to boost bike sales.

## Final Conclusion

The Bike Sales Dashboard shows that higher-income individuals and middle-aged customers are the primary bike buyers. Short-distance commuters (1-2 miles) are more likely to purchase bikes, highlighting the need for targeted marketing. Single individuals and certain regions show higher sales, presenting opportunities for localized promotions. To boost sales, the company can offer installment plans, commuting-focused campaigns, and senior-friendly options. Implementing these insights will help increase revenue, improve customer engagement, and drive business growth
